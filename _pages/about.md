I am currently a Lecturer at [Anhui University](https://en.ahu.edu.cn/), Hefei, China, and also affiliated as a Researcher/PI with Tian-Hai Flow Control Co., LTD. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/), Seoul, Korea, under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew Teoh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ueRkvQMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research there was funded by the South Korea Brain Pool (BP) Program, and my research at Monash was funded by the MARIE SK≈ÅODOWSKA-CURIE Fellowship. I am proud to be a BP and MSCA fellowship awardee. My research expertise lies in **image processing** (both medical and natural), **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **pattern recognition**,  and **privacy protection**. 

I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Information Technology, **[Monash University](https://monash.edu/)**, and my B.Sc. degree with the National Training Base for Life Science and Technology Talents program at **[Huazhong Agricultural University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/)**. I was briefly enrolled as a Ph.D. student in molecular metabolism at Virginia Tech, USA. Since 2024, I have been a Guest Editor for the Symmetry journal and have served as an Area Chair (AC) for BMVC. I also serve as an Editor for SR. Please feel free to use my [Public PGP Key](https://www.google.com/search?q=/files/publicPGP.asc) when you email me.

I am proudly a participant in a charity project called [**Ëìù‰ø°Â∞ÅË°åÂä® (Blue Letter Project)**](http://www.lanxinfeng.org/), which supports children left behind in rural areasüíñüíñ. I was interviewed about my involvement, and you can read the interview [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bo23lhRF_RxtpezyHff_mQ).
