I am currently a Lecturer at [Anhui University](https://en.ahu.edu.cn/), Hefei, China, and also affiliated as a Researcher/PI with Tian-Hai Flow Control Co., LTD. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/), Seoul, Korea, under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew Teoh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ueRkvQMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research there was funded by the South Korea Brain Pool (BP) Program, and my research at Monash was funded by the MARIE SK≈ÅODOWSKA-CURIE Fellowship. I am proud to be a BP and MSCA fellowship awardee. My research expertise lies in **image processing** (both medical and natural), **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **pattern recognition**.

I earned my Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Information Technology, **[Monash University](https://monash.edu/)**, with [Prof. Jin Zhe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=N-szqToAAAAJ) and [Prof. Wong KokSheik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oMjrLWcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to that, I completed my B.Sc. degree with the National Training Base for Life Science and Technology Talents program at **[Huazhong Agricultural University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/)**, Wuhan, China, under the supervision of Prof. Yang Zaiqing. I was briefly enrolled as a Ph.D. student in molecular metabolism at Virginia Tech, USA.

During my Ph.D. studies (2018-2021), I had the privilege of visiting and collaborating with several European professors as a visiting Ph.D. student under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions through the **[IDENTITY project](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/df/identity/)**. These collaborations included working with [Prof. Jean-Luc Dugelay](https://www.eurecom.fr/~dugelay/) at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/), France; [Prof. Massimo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DdyCvCgAAAAJ&hl=en) at [University of Sassari](https://en.uniss.it/), Italy; and [Prof. Andreas](https://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~uhl/) at Salzburg University, Austria. Additionally, I visited and worked with [Prof. Guo Zhenghua](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dbR6bD0AAAAJ) at Tsinghua University, China, supported by the Monash Global Research Excellence grant. In 2021, I also completed a wonderful internship at TCL Research.

Since 2024, I have been a Guest Editor for the Symmetry journal and have served as an Area Chair (AC) for BMVC. I also serve as an Editor for SR.
