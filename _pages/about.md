I am a Post-Doc at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/). My current research focuses on image processing, pattern recognition.

I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of IT, the [Monash University](https://monash.edu/) (Malaysia Campus).
Before that, I received my B.Sci. degree in Biotech from [Huazhong Agricultural University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/). 
I was briefly enrolled (2014.6-2014.12) as a Ph.D. student in molecular metabolism at Virginia Tech before I decided to withdraw and became a Java software engineer.
