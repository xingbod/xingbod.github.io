I am a Post-Doc at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/), Seoul, Korea, under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew Teoh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ueRkvQMAAAAJ&hl=en). My current research focuses on image processing, computer vision and pattern recognition, and is funded by South Korea Brain Pool (BP) Program. 

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Faculty of Information Technology, the [Monash University](https://monash.edu/), where my main advisor is [Prof. Jin Zhe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=N-szqToAAAAJ), and associate supervisor is [Prof. Wong KokSheik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oMjrLWcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 
Before that, I received my B.Sci. degree in Biotech from [Huazhong Agricultural University](http://www.hzau.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China, under the supervision of Prof. Yang Zaiqing. 
I was briefly enrolled (2014.6-2014.12) as a Ph.D. student in molecular metabolism at Virginia Tech (Virginia, USA),
and later I decided to withdraw and worked as a Java software engineer for almost 3 years (to save enough money for Monash). 

During my Ph.D. (2018-2021), I visited and worked with EU professors as a visiting Ph.D. student under Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions through the [IDENTITY](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/df/identity/) project.
Including [Prof. Jean-luc Dugelay](https://www.eurecom.fr/~dugelay/) at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/), France, on thermal face recogntion, 
[Prof. Massimo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DdyCvCgAAAAJ&hl=en) at [University of Sassari](https://en.uniss.it/), Italy,
[Prof. Andreas](https://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~uhl/) at Salzburg University, Austria. 
I visited and worked with [Prof. Guo Zhenghua](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dbR6bD0AAAAJ) at Tsinghua University, China, under the Monash Gloabl Research Exchange grant.
I also spent wonderful intern time at TCL Research in 2021.

        We present a De-Bayer-Filter simulator based on deep neural networks to generate a monochrome raw image from the colored raw image, and achieve the low-light image enhancement by fusing colored raw data with synthesized monochrome raw data. </font>
