title: "A cancellable face template scheme based on nonlinear multi-dimension spectral hashing"
collection: publications
excerpt: "The exposure of face templates potentially leads to severe security and privacy risks. We propose a cancelable transform, namely nonlinear multidimension spectral hashing (NMDSH) to protect face template.NMDSH utilizes a many-to-one function to transform real-valued deep face feature vector into binary code. The transformed template thus possesses strong non-invertible property. Next, a highly nonlinear softmod function is further adapted into the scheme to provide an additional layer of protection against similarity-based attack. Experiment results suggest that NMDSH can preserve the accuracy performance largely.<br/><img src='/images/nmdsh.png'>"
