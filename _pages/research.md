Research and Teaching
======
To date, I have published over 50 peer-reviewed articles [see here](https://dblp.org/pid/237/0125.html), in venues including CVPR, ECCV, WACV, AAAI, ICML, IEEE TIFS, Information Fusion, IEEE JBHI, and Pattern Recognition. These works reflect not only personal dedication but, more importantly, the collaborative effort of numerous talented colleagues, students, and mentors. In addition to academic publications, I have co-invented multiple patents covering technologies related to PET image reconstruction, biometric fusion systems, and intelligent visual monitoring ([see here](https://www.patentguru.com/cn/inventor/%E8%91%A3%E5%85%B4%E6%B3%A2?q=%E5%AE%89%E5%BE%BD%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6)).  I have been fortunate to lead 5 research projects as Principal Investigator, including grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Korean NRF Brain Pool Program, and several regional and postdoctoral programs. In addition, I have participated in 3 major collaborative projects, including two NSFC General Programs and the EU Horizon 2020 Marie Curie project. Iâ€™m grateful to all collaborators and funding agencies for their continued support. I welcome any collaboration opportunities from industry sections. 

I actively mentor many undergraduate research interns. My teaching emphasizes student-centered innovation, including blog-based assignments, literature-driven learning, and peer review. These efforts reflect my ongoing commitment to supporting student growth both in and beyond the classroom. 
  

:fire: Our research on AI course design based on the Blog Assignment was reported by national media; see the report at [here](http://guoqing.china.com.cn/2025-02/24/content_117729958.htm?f=pad&a=true) and [here](http://news.ahwang.cn/shangxun/20250224/2814966.html).
